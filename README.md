Student Performance Predictor

End-to-End Machine Learning Project (Regression)

Overview

The Student Performance Predictor is a simple end-to-end machine learning project that predicts a student’s writing score based on multiple demographic, academic, and preparation-related factors.

This project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle, including:

Data ingestion and preprocessing

Training and evaluating multiple regression models

Selecting the best-performing model

Deploying the model using a Flask web application

This is my first complete ML project, built to understand how machine learning models move from experimentation to a usable application.

Problem Statement

This is a regression problem where the goal is to predict a numerical writing score using a mix of:

Categorical features (gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type, etc.)

Numerical features (math score, reading score)

The model is currently trained only to predict writing score based on the provided inputs.

Features

Predicts student writing score using multiple input factors

Trains and evaluates multiple regression models

Automatically selects the best-performing model

Clean and simple Flask web interface

Supports custom user input through a form-based UI
